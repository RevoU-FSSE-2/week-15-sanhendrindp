# About

This project I created based on the shop's inventory management app where users can monitor and place orders for goods. In this REST API, there are 2 roles, the admin role and the user role. Basically, they can do the same CRUD functionality, but for the admin role, he can delete the users list registered.

# API Routes in Details

</p>

1. **POST /users/signup** :
   Users need to input an email and password. But actually, there is a role that needs to be input. By default, if a user does not input a role, then his role just as user. A user can become an admin if he inputs the admin role.
